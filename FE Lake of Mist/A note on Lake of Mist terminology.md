In general, just because Lake of Mist uses terminology from abother game does not mean it is set in the same universe.
## Laguz and beorc
I have never played a Tellius game. I just find the race angle they and Sacred Stones took to be interesting and worth exploring on my own terms. Since the beastfolk of Ranselia are functionally more similar to Tellian laguz than to Ylissean beastfolk, I'm using Radiant terms instead of Awakening terms.
