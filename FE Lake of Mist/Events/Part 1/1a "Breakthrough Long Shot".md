#fe-lake-of-mist 
## Story
After being captured in [[0d "Bear Trap"]], [[FE Lake of Mist/Characters/Seolyeong|Seolyeong]] is brought to a dungeon in Carcaso. After some time, though, Seolyeong meets the aspiring soldiers [[Valon]] and [[Lilina]], neither of whom think Seolyeong is as bad as advertised. After this and many other slights they've noticed, the two of them decide to take action, and start a prison break.
## Gameplay
All units from Chapter 0d are removed except for Seolyeong. This is also an escape map, but with an optional rout objective which will also end the map. Completing the optional objective will eventually lead to early recruitment of [[Papillon]] in [[5a "Palma of My Hand"]], who normally will only be recruited in [[8a "Inciting Incident"]].
