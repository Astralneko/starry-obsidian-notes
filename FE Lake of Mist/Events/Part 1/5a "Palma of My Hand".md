## Story
[[FE Lake of Mist/Characters/Seolyeong|Seolyeong]] and company have reached the border town of Palma. However, [[Chionis]] is more than aware of what has happened, and wishes to recapture them; since Argonese troops still control Palma, he has jurisdiction to do so.
## Gameplay
If the player routed [[1a "Breakthrough Long Shot"]], on turn 1, [[Papillon]] enters the map ahead of Chionis, who is chasing them down; Seolyeong promises to protect her and so she joins the party. Otherwise, Chionis enters the map paired up with a transformed Papillon, making him effectively a Wyvern Rider for the duration of the map.
