#fe-lake-of-mist 
This chapter is the final chapter of the Lake of Mist prologue.
Like Chapters 0b and 0c, but unlike other chapters of similar labels, Chapter 0d is required to progress to Chapter 1.
## Story
Some of the enemies from [[0c "The Titling"]] state that [[Argonia]] is planning something at the border with [[Darralucia]]. Therefore, the lord of [[Valencia]] leads an expedition to the border, only to be ambushed by a frankly ludicrous number of Argonian soldiers, notably including [[Mars]], the current bearer of the [[Fire Emblem]]. This is entirely too much force (especially since Mars is effectively invincible), so the team must try to escape. This seems to have been the goal of the enemies, though.
## Gameplay
Chapter 0d is nominally an escape map, showing the player that not all maps will require routing the enemy. However, monsters will capture the player once they bring [[FE Lake of Mist/Characters/Seolyeong|Seolyeong]] to the escape point, where story-wise, it's revealed what the title means: every member of the player's team is captured. In desperation, Seolyeong transforms to try and scatter the enemies, but [[1a "Breakthrough Long Shot"|this just ends up with her muzzled]].
