## Story
The first chapter of Lake of Mist has protagonist [[Seolyeong Toran|Seolyeong]] spar with her father [[Huyao Toran|Huyao]], in a field outside of the town of Albacet.
## Gameplay
Unlike other chapters, the player does not control Seolyeong. Instead, they control Huyao, which serves to teach the player how to move, select actions, and trade items, as Huyao has two weapons (a lance and an axe) and a vulnerary, while Suyeong has only a dagger at this time.
