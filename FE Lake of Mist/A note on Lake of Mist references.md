#fe-lake-of-mist #disclaimer
In general, just because Lake of Mist uses terminology from abother game does not mean it is set in the same universe.
## Laguz and beorc
I have never played a Tellius game. I just find the race angle they and Sacred Stones took to be interesting and worth exploring on my own terms. Since the beastfolk of Ranselia are functionally more similar to Tellian laguz than to Ylissean beastfolk, I'm using Radiant terms instead of Awakening terms.
## Unit references
Units that reference those from the canon games need not be named after those from the canon games, and unlike FE17 Emblems, need not remember the source game or anything.
The following is a list of unit references, along with if they are actually the same character:
- [[Valon]]: Roy (FE6)
- [[Lilina]]: Lilina (FE6)
- [[Chihiro]]: Summoner (FEH), *remembers FEH well enough to recognize most other FEH references*
- [[Gullveig]]: Gullveig (FEH), *remembers FEH, though is from a timeline where the summoner lost*
- [[Nifl]]: Nifl (FEH)
- [[Papillon]]: the Fell Twins (FE17)
