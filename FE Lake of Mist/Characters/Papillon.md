Papillon is one of several expies in Fire Emblem Lake of Mist. In her case, she is an expy for [Veyle](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Veyle) of [Fire Emblem Engage](https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/FE17).
## Backstory
A manakete found in [[Coryucco]] by [[Argonia]]n troops, she was captured and used as a slave by [[Mars]] to awaken the [[Fire Emblem]]. Of course, by weakening her to the point she was unable to escape, he also made her unable to use much magic, as seen in [[0d Bear Trap]].
## Plot
### Part 1
She is kept in the same camp as [[FE Lake of Mist/Characters/Seolyeong|Seolyeong]] after the events of [[0d Bear Trap]], and can be freed in [[1a Breakthrough Long Shot]] - but only successfully gets away if the map is routed. (She's also freed in the post-map cutscene if you didn't do so on map.)
If she is not freed here, she appears as an enemy in [[5a Palma of My Hand]], where [[Mars]] forces her into a crazed state via the [[Fire Emblem]]. (As she was raised in [[Coryucco]], she does use the Coryuccan name for the Fire Emblem.)
## Stats
If Chapter 1a's optional objective is incomplete, Papillon instead joins at [[8a Inciting Incident]] at level 7, with the second column of bases, and Papillon won't have any support points with Valon.
Also note that the Age column translates manakete years to human years, which in Lake of Mist is a ratio of 50:1 or so.
