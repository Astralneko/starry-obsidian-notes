The **Republic of Coryucco** is a small nation to the south of [[Darralucia]]. As the name implies, it styles itself as the strongest democracy in the known world, though fellow historically democratic states [[Newbeglia]] and [[Isola della Nebbia]] joke that this is only because it has a small population even for its small size. It hasn't even been democratic for particularly long, as it used a similar political structure to [[Darralucia]] and [[Newbeglia]] several generations past.
## Demographics
Coryucco is the only nation aside from Darralucia whose population is mostly laguz.
