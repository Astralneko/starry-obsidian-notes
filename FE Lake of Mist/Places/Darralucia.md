The **Caliphate of Darralucia** is the nation which Lake of Mist begins in, and is the homeland of the protagonist. Its population is predominantly laguz.
## Origin
Darralucia is based on Andalusia, and carries on a similar name, albeit with some tweaks. As it is the starting location and birthplace of protagonist [[FE Lake of Mist/Characters/Seolyeong|Seolyeong]], the name origin of "dar a la luz" (to give birth) is metatextually sensible.
## Structure
Darralucia is divided into several provinces, mostly along the lines of laguz clans, such that each province's majority population is one laguz clan.

The central province, [[Granata]], is the only one with a large beorc population, but most provinces do have at least a significant minority of them. Darralucia *has* a beorc royal house and a few other noble houses, but as they are in the minority, Darralucia is still typecast by other nations as a beastfolk nation, much like its maritime neighbor [[Coryucco]].

The real moneymaker province, though, is [[Córroba]], due to its massive port town [[Málaga]] at one end of the Mercanti Sea, allowing for easy export of Darralucian resources, and easy import of products from as far as [[Newbeglia]].
## Relations
[[Argonia]] HATES Darralucia. Really, Argonia hates all laguz, Darralucia just happens to be the closest and strongest example of such.
