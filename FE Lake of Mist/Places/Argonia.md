The **Holy Empire of Argonia** is the "main antagonist" force of Lake of Mist, as several, but not all, of the main antagonists are from Argonia.
## Origin
Argonia is based most directly on the regions of Aragon and Castile in Spain. However, relative to a map of Europe, Argonia would also control Catalunha, Galicia, Extremadura, and most of Portugal (i.e. Lusitania), while its fellow Spain-adjacent state [[Darralucia]] would also control Valencia and Murcia.
## Relations
Argonia is the most obvious anti-laguz force in Ranselia. The official policy is to not treat them as persons. Although this is obviously not practiced by everyone in Argonia, most in Argonia will hold negative stereotypes of laguz.
