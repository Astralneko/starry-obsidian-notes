The **Kingdom of Yverçonne** is the most northerly area accessible in Lake of Mist. 
## Origin
Yverçonne is based on France. It is named primarily after Yvelines and Essonne, two of the departments of the Île-de-France region, the seat of power in the country. Yvelines contains Versailles, and thus the palace thereof, that used to be the seat of power in France.
## Relations
[[Argonia]] does have a treaty with Yverçonne that effectively make them allies, but they do NOT like each other - both just have similar goals for the time being. In fact, after [[Mars]] "defiles" Mt. Lakagígar by bringing the fully powered [[Fire Emblem]] back to the mountain, Yverçole declares war on Argonia.
