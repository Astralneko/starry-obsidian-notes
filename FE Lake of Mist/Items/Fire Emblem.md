## Name
The **Fire Emblem** goes by several different names - in fact, it is only one of the game's six nations that refer to it as the Fire Emblem.
It is first introduced as the Shield of the Ouroboros. The Fire Emblem is partially the reasoning behind the "Holy" part of [[Argonia|the Holy Empire of Argonia]], who also refer to it directly as the Fire Emblem. [[Yverçonne|Yverçolian]] sources refer to it as "Lakagígarmóðu", while [[Isola della Nebbia|Nebbian]] sources refer to it as "la Corona di Cenere", and [[Coryucco|Coryuccan]] and [[Newbeglia|Newbeglian]] sources refer to it as "alf Layla wa-Layla".
## Abilities
The chief ability of the Fire Emblem is mental manipulation. However, once it receives enough power, it can create "Mist Manifestations", thoughtforms of people that can perform tasks, including battle.
## Gameplay
The Fire Emblem is first shown to the player as early as [[0d Bear Trap]], though it only has 1 Might in that chapter. As the Shield collects sacred power from the land it travels on, its Might increases; this means that its Might is equal to the chapter number plus 1.

Near the end of the game, the Fire Emblem is used to summon [[Gullveig]], the Time-Eating Dragon.
