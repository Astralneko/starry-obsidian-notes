The "Fire Emblem" goes by several different names. It is first introduced as the Shield of the Ouroboros. The Fire Emblem is partially the reasoning behind the "Holy" part of [[Argonia|the Holy Empire of Argonia]], who also refer to it directly as the Fire Emblem. [[Yverçole|Yverçolian]] sources refer to it as "Lakagígarmóðu", while [[Isola della Nebbia|Nebbian]] sources refer to it as "Corona di Cenere".

The Fire Emblem is first shown to the player as early as [[0d "Bear Trap"]], though it only has 1 Might in that chapter. As the Shield collects sacred power from the land it travels on, its Might increases; this means that its Might is equal to the chapter number plus 1.

Near the end of the game, the Fire Emblem is used to summon [[Gullveig]], the Time-Eating Dragon.
