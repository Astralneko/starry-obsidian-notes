The **Nephrite Constellation** is a set of spirits in *Drawn to AfterLife* who, together among them, only have one "life-swatch", despite being separate spirits. They are also referred to as "the siblings of Mirai", in reference to the clan to which they belong, and the scarves each wear that are a key part of the clan's wealth.
# Real-world meaning
In general, the Nephrite Constellation is a magical version of a system. It is of note that in-universe, although this is notable, it is not weird. Other forms of plurality are shown in-text, such as Rokaselan spiritspeakers, so although this representation can be, in some ways, stereotypical, it is explicitly not the only allowed representation.
# Members
## Hatena
Hatena is the first member of the Constellation to be introduced, with her so-called death in the prologue.

# Trivia
* Mirai is Japanese for "future". However, each of the members of the Nephrite Constellation has a notable name too:
	*  Hatena: Originates from a Japanese likely-pun meaning "at the end" - whence "future's end," because she dies at the beginning of Drawn to AfterLife.
	* Charon: The Greek ferryman of the dead. Charon Mirai takes it upon himself to carry the other spirits on his back, as their protector.
