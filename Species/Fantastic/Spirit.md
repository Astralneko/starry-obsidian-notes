[[Fantastic]]
These refer *explicitly* to species that are usually reincarnated or undead forms of another species, as well as species that are immortal by default.
So for an example, dragons are not Spirits, because dragons are usually described as long-lived, but not immortal unless the dragon is a deity or something.
As another example, angels *are* Spirits, because while they never died, they also *cannot* die by natural causes.
