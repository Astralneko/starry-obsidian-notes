Exactly what it sounds like.

Note that because every bit of worldbuilding we make exists in my head, there will be all kinds of stuff mixed in here. This is not meant to be parsed as a single block. That will fail. Fortunately, everything should be robustly tagged - so for example, all notes related to the Spectradom worldbuilding project will be in the spectradom tag.
