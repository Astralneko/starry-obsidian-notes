### Notes

- The non-affricate aspirated stops are variably affricated in Haltzeonian dialects; this is particularly the case for stressed aspirated stops.
- Plain stops are usually slack voiced [b̥ d̥ d̥͡ʒ̊ g̊ ɢ̥], but this is somewhat variable, and the primary way these are distinguished is aspiration (or a lack thereof).
    - The plain uvular stop has other allophones in certain dialects - namely [ʁ̊ ʀ̆].
