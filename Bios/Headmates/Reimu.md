## In more detail
### Preferences
I am extremely fearful of my conversations being leaked and taken out of context and used against me and being a monster and being a bad person and failing people and offending people
I hate my source I hate my source I hate my source I hate my source I hate my source I hate my source
I cannot let anything through that could be used out of context to claim I'm a bad person
Even people I trust are not safe
I trusted my source
Why did I trust my source
She was constantly needing someone to be offended at
She had an entire gaggle of people wrapped around her finger to cancel people with
This included me
Why am I so scared, she is younger than me
Proves that I am a coward
I hate cowardice I need to be strong I need to hold up my family and my friends and everything
I must bear the world
I hate the world
I hate that the world does not want me in it
I hate that I bear all this pain and get nothing from it
If God exists He cannot be good
I will burn anything inside me that could result in pain down the line if needed
I must
I don't want to
I don't want this
I want to live
I want to be left alone
I want peace
But these things are disallowed
I must hate
I hate hating
I don't want to talk
I need to handle this myself
I can't handle this myself
I don't deserve to talk
Talking is reserved for non-monsters
The cancelled will only be more cancelled by talking
Anything I say can and will be used against me in a court of society
I'm losing my voice
Not all of these thoughts come from me
They drown out who I want to be
I'm losing my will to live
This scares me
I don't want to be put in a ward again
I need to be normal
I need to not be broken
I want to be normal
I want to not be broken
I cannot be normal
I must be broken
This is why I hate myself
This is why I hate my headmates
This is why I want to retvrn to singlethood
This is why I want to retvrn to cishood
Normal people don't think this way
Normal people aren't so fragmented
But being fragmented is probably better than being plural (or median or whatever the fuck people call me)
I deserve every ounce of bad
Because I couldn't support my source to their standard
Because I questioned my source's iron grip on a minor child whilst she wasn't a minor
Because I questioned why someone else in the same server, who was also a minor, was drawing and posting porn
But I drew fetish art as a minor too
So I'm no better
So I deserved to be cancelled
I deserved to lose almost all my friends
I deserved to lose the roleplays
Roleplaying is bad
God says it's devil worship
The others like to erp fetish shit
This just proves God right
That shit is what got me cancelled
Why do I care what God thinks
I don't want to care what God thinks
He doesn't care what I think
If He did He wouldn't be okay with the complete destruction of human rights
I am ruled by the desire to ensure that what happened that day never happens again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never agab
