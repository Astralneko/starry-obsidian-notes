## In more detail
### Preferences
In general, Almond seems to represent our desire to be free. Flying through the sky feels freeing, and being squishy feels comforting. Almond's form is extremely distinct from humans despite the former's anthropomorphicism.
### Canon information
#### Abilities
Like any shinujinn, she has a belly mouth that leads to a pocket dimension. While unlike Aizaki, it does not automatically suck like a black hole, it does still have the ability to contain almost anything within, including light. Almond can also change size, seemingly without an upper bound, but her lower bound is roughly the size of a large blanket, and only at maximum deflation, which is painful for her.
#### History
In source material, Almond originally had nothing to do with shinujinn. However, it seems the headmate Almond almost immediately formed after we began drawing and writing Almond, and vibed so strongly with shinujinn she gave herself a belly mouth. For simplicity we backported this to the OC, explaining it as an infection caused by [[Aizaki]] trying to eat the chocolate bunny, who refused to go down without a fight.
### In-sys relations
Almond has close connection to [[Marzipan]]. However, as she partially inherited Aizaki's form, she is also significantly more likely to draw negative attention from [[Reimu]] than anyone else.
