### Canon information
#### Abilities
Water manipulation. This *can* include materials that are made predominantly of water, but are referred to as something else - for example, fruit juices, and yes, blood. However, Estariel needs to be able to see the water to manipulate it.
In her source, her spirit was twinged by the [[Ruviyatang]], giving herself the ability to "melt" (and reform) her own body - this is due to Estariel's preferences above influencing her canon abilities, and we tend to go with "if the fictive does it, their source should too." The result is akin to ink, and so is called as much.
