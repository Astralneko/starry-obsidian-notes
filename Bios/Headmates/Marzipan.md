## In more detail
### Preferences
Marzipan is very interested in dressing up, and often spends time daydreaming about/imagining the body in different outfits. She is hugely tied to gender envy, after all.
Marzipan is ace, and *will* joke about it in combination with her species. In fact, the singletsona's romantic and sexual preferences are derived chiefly from Marzipan - despite its characteristics otherwise being mostly derived from the hosts. <span style="font-size: 0.833em;">Though that is partially a coincidence, as given there are (usually slight) differences in, for example, what certain members find attractive or not, the declared singletsona preferences here are also just set for minimal discomfort and maximal openness.</span>
~~Also has an interest in *being* hypnotized, for some reason.~~
### Canon information
#### Abilities
Telepathic powers. Locking eyes with Marzipan links one's brain to her, though she has to link both eyes with the target - that's why she usually covers one eye. Her telepathic abilities include suggestion/hypnosis. Also has pyrokinetic abilities.
Note that Marzipan cannot hypnotize someone into doing something they didn't already want to do. Attempting to do so would break the hypnosis.
#### History
### In-sys relations
Of the other members formed from Aizaki fragmentation, Marzipan has the best relationship with [[Yankee]]. However, they both seem to be connected to each other, [[Kalia]], [[Hikari]], and [[Almond]], with heavy memory sharing involved.
