### Consonants

| **Nasal**       |  **short**   | m       | n        | ng/ŋ    |          |

| **Trill**       |  **plain**   |         | r        |         |          |
| ^               |  **light**   |         | ry/rr    |         |          |
| ^               |   **dark**   |         | r’       |         |          |

For the non-sonorants in the above table that have two representations, use the second one in the coda. Using the second one in the onset is allowed, though. Astaryuu themself defaults to⟨ps bz kh⟩ intervocalically, but will use the ⟨y⟩ spelling if there is a consonant or a word boundary before them.
For the velar nasal, ŋ is in parentheses because it can be replaced by either of the representations for short /ŋ/, or by h.
For the sake of compatibility, digraphs are usually preferred over diacritics when it comes to consonants. However, as ⟨ċ ṣ ẏ ḥ ḳ ŋ⟩ have their own codepoints, they are more likely to be supported, especially ⟨ċ ŋ⟩ as they are in Latin Extended-A instead of Latin Extended Additional.

| **Close-mid** | (î)       | ē/é/ee    | (ë)      | ^         | ^         | ^        | (ö)       | ō/ó/oo    | (û)      |
| **Open-mid**  | (ê)       | e         | (ȧ)      | (è)       | ȧ/à       | (ò)      | (ȧ)       | o         | (ô)      |
| **Open**      |           | <         | <        | (ä)       | a         | (å)      |           | <         | <        |
The accents and digraphs are listed for compatibility. A with overdot is in Latin Extended-B, as ȧ, so it should be acceptable in most of the same instances as ċ.
For vowels, the romanization does not distinguish light, dark, and plain vowels by default, as distinction is often unnecessary due to [[Pezen/Karentahn/High Karanesa language/High Karanesa phonology]]. If needed, stick a y after the vowel for light vowels, a w after the vowel for dark vowels, and a ‘ before the vowel for plain vowels. These filler y, w, and ‘ are *not* actual consonants, and so do *not* have vowels filled in between them and following consonants if the conjugation calls for it. Light and dark vowels can also be replaced by diacritics as listed in the above table, but using a digraph is preferred here. Since the digraphs mess with clarity, it is recommended that dictionaries use the diacritics.
