'''Condero''' is a city in the region of [[Shadar]]. It is the largest settlement in [[Daman]].

In [[Drawn to AfterLife]], the [[Mirai twins]] are from Condero. As a result, the story begins there.

## History
Condero is one of the so-called "phoenix cities" which formed after the collapse of the original nation of Shadar. Originally, Condero had a distinct state of the same name, for which the city was its heart. However, during the [[Century of Strife]], the duchy of Daman took over the city, in spite of its associated castle being smaller than Condero's. This seige of Condero is talked about in epic poetry of the time period, as it is arguably the single most powerful example of the political climate of the time.

Daman was one of the four signatories to the original [[Shadaric Bank]] agreement, which was penned in [[Lindae]] but involved the [[Family of Daman]], who rule over Condero to this day. Therefore, Condero considers itself to be instrumental in the termination of the Century of Strife in spite of the related official documents being made elsewhere.

## Geography
Condero sits on the northern edge of a river somewhat inland from the coast, which is named after the city as a result. The [[Condero River]] is a tributary of the larger and more southerly [[Oyalla River]]. Although traffic on the river itself is minimal, the river serves as a natural road for traveling merchants and the like, making Condero both a popular source and destination for trade across Shadar.

On either side of the Condero River is a grassland that, owing in part to its history as a floodplain for the river, is rather fertile. While much of this grassland has therefore been turned into farmland, some of the natural state of this land still remains. The Condero River does still flood, but to a lesser degree than in the past, as the immediate coast of the river has grown higher relative to the water level itself due to erosion.
