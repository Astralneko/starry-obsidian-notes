**Mahosin** is the basis for most magic in the world of Pezen. It is a protein that many, but not all, living beings across the world of Pezen possess.
# Mechanics
There are eight "varieties" or "flavors" of mahosin: red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, black, and white. The first six flavors are associated with the core elements of Pezeni magic, while the other two can suppress and enhance the effects of the other flavors.
All varieties of mahosin have an unknown element which is able to interact with the so-called [[Imaginary Plane]].
The most common source of mahosin for spellcraft is plants that produce it, which are crushed into dyes and applied to rough cards - such that the crafted spell can be activated with a flick. Such cards are [[swatch|swatches]]. 
## Flavors
Red magic is associated with fire and warmth.
Yellow magic is associated with earth, rock, and metal.
Green magic is associated with light and life. Healing magic is usually green at least in part.
Cyan magic is associated with water, coolness, and even ice.
Blue magic is associated with the sky, the air, and the wind.
Magenta magic is associated with darkness and death.
## Mixture
Most spells use multiple flavors of magic at the same time, as well as non-mahosin ingredients that channel the magic into a specific purpose. For example, while healing magic is green-aligned in general, specific spells require other flavors or ingredients. A burn-treating spell will use a [[swatch]] which is colored both green and cyan, as well as a cloth or some other wrapping item - the swatch is used on the cloth, then the now-cold cloth is wrapped around the burn as one might do with cold water on mild burns in real life. The spell prevents the burn from causing further damage, and slowly reverses the damage it did do.
