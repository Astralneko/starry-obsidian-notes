The **Eternal Jade Scarf** is a holy treasure which was acquired by [[Koerai Mirai]] 71 years before the events of [[Drawn to AfterLife]]. It was originally said to give longevity, with a spell imbued in it that could theoretically bring one back from the dead. [[Reaca Mirai]] cut it and used it on her daughter, trying to save the scarf's spell for use at a later time as well. However, as a result, the spell was imperfect, with her daughter reviving, but split into Charon and Hatena. After Hatena's death, the two halves of the scarf fused back together, becoming the long Eternal Jade Scarf once again.
