## Consonants
Matelian, like other Low Kanafan languages, is known for merging a lot of consonants. However, of them, Matelian has the lowest number, perhaps because they're in the opposite direction from the hearth of Low Kanafan compared to the rest of its family. Low Kanafan is centered in the eastern Inkwell Glacier area, but Matelian was pushed back from the Linnekarta Mountains and eventually into an exodus across central Quillan.

Like in other Old Low Kanafan languages, the uvular stop became uvularization and then implosivity, but in Matelian and Citalian, the uvular trill became /q/ and the alveolar trill became /ɺ/, merging with the lateral /l/.

|               | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Guttural |
| ------------: | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
|      **Stop** | p      | tˠ       | c ⟨ć⟩   | k ⟨c⟩ | q        |
| **Fricative** | ɸ      | s\~x     | ɕ ⟨ś⟩   |       | χ ⟨h⟩    |
|     **Nasal** | m      |          | ɲ ⟨ń⟩   | ŋ ⟨n⟩ |          |
|   **Lateral** |        | ɺ ⟨l⟩    | ʎ ⟨ĺ⟩   |       |          |
| **Implosive** | ɓ̥ ⟨b⟩ |          | ʄ̊ ⟨d⟩  |       |          |
### Notes
/j w/ are not distinct from /i u/ in Matelian, as Matelian does not abhor hiatus. Additionally, the palatal diacritics can be replaced with a following ⟨i⟩ in ASCII contexts.
/ɺ/ becomes \[ɫ] in the coda and \[ʎ] before \[i].
## Vowels

|               | i    | u    | e   | o   | æ   | ʌ   |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tone 1** ŕ  | iː˦˥ | uː˦˥ | e˦˥ | o˦˥ | æ˦˥ | ʌ˦˥ |
| **Tone 2** r̂ | i˥˧  | ʊ˥˧  | e˥˧ | o˥˧ | æ˥˧ | ʌ˥˧ |
| **Tone 3** r  | i˧   | u˧   | e˧  | o˧  | æ˧  | ɑ˧  |
| **Tone 4** r̃ | ɪː˩˧ | ʊː˩˧ | ɛ˩˧ | ɔ˩˧ | ɐ˩˧ | ʌ˩˧ |
| **Tone 5** ṙ  | ɪ˩   | ʊ˩   | ɛ˩  | ɔ˩  | æ˩  | ɑ˩  |
### Notes
/æ ʌ/ is written as ⟨a r⟩. This requires combining diacritics for r, which is why r is the example grapheme letter. Tones 3 and 5 for /i/ are written as ⟨ı i⟩ in order for easier differentiation, but this is more like iota, as their capitals are ⟨I İ⟩.
In all tones, /ii̯ ei̯ ou̯ uu̯/ become \[ɪɨ̯ ɛɨ̯ ʌʉ̯ ɤʉ̯]. /æu̯ ʌi̯/ are strictly forbidden. /i̯ u̯/ are written as ⟨y w⟩ if and only if an adjacent phoneme is their corresponding syllabic vowel.
## Phonotactics

### Syllable structure
Matelian is maximally CVF, where F is any continuant. Unlike in e.g. [[Rokadong]], /ɺ/ is not a stop, but that's because it becomes \[l]. However, note that coda fricatives are only allowed at the end of a word, and all coda nasals become /ƞ/ (the whatever nasal), defaulting to \[ɲ ŋ] if the next word starts with a front or back vowel respectively.
### Assimilation
Assimilation only occurs on the whatever nasal, which matches place of articulation with the next consonant.
