## Consonants
Matelian, like other Low Kanafan languages, is known for merging a lot of consonants. However, of them, Matelian has the lowest number, perhaps because they're in the opposite direction from the hearth of Low Kanafan compared to the rest of its family. Low Kanafan is centered in the eastern Inkwell Glacier area, but Matelian was pushed back from the Linnekarta Mountains and eventually into an exodus across central Quillan.

Like in other Low Kanafan languages, the uvular stop became uvularization and then implosivity, but in Matelian and Citalian, the uvular trill became /q/ and the alveolar trill became /ɺ/, merging with the lateral /l/.

|     **Nasal** | m      |             | ɲ ⟨nh⟩          | ŋ ⟨n⟩   |          |
|   **Lateral** |        | ɺ ⟨l⟩       | ʎ ⟨lh⟩          |         |          |
| **Implosive** | ɓ̥ ⟨b⟩ |             | ʄ̊ ⟨d⟩          | (ɠ) ⟨g⟩ |          |
### Notes
/j w/ are not distinct from /i u/ in Matelian, as Matelian does not abhor hiatus.
/ɺ/ becomes \[ɫ] in the coda and \[ʎ] before \[i].
The three parenthesized phonemes, /z ʑ ɠ/, are historically existent in Matelian, but in its modern form, these rarely are unmerged with another phoneme - /s ɕ ʄ/ respectively. In nativewords, these phonemes do not exist at all.
The labial and palatal implosives are pronounced like \[b ɟ] if either occur *after* the close vowels /i u/.
The velar nasal /ŋ/ derives from the alveolar nasal /n/, which velarized in similar manner to /t s/, where this velarization is variable. Thus, even if a language that loans from Matelian has /ŋ/ in the position, it might still loan it as /n/.
## Vowels
### Chart

|               | i    | u    | e   | o   | æ   | ʌ   |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tone 1** ŕ  | iː˦˥ | uː˦˥ | e˦˥ | o˦˥ | æ˦˥ | ʌ˦˥ |
| **Tone 2** r̂ | i˥˧  | ʊ˥˧  | e˥˧ | o˥˧ | æ˥˧ | ʌ˥˧ |
| **Tone 3** r  | i˧   | u˧   | e˧  | o˧  | æ˧  | ɑ˧  |
| **Tone 4** r̃ | ɪː˩˧ | ʊː˩˧ | ɛ˩˧ | ɔ˩˧ | ɐ˩˧ | ʌ˩˧ |
| **Tone 5** ṙ  | ɪ˩   | ʊ˩   | ɛ˩  | ɔ˩  | ɐ˩  | ɑ˩  |
### Notes
/æ ʌ/ is written as ⟨a r⟩. This requires combining diacritics for r, which is why r is the example grapheme letter. Tones 3 and 5 for /i/ are written as ⟨ı i⟩ in order for easier differentiation, but this is more like iota, as their capitals are ⟨I İ⟩.
In all tones, /ii̯ ei̯ ou̯ uu̯/ become \[ɪɨ̯ ɛɨ̯ ʌʉ̯ ɤʉ̯]. /æu̯ ʌi̯/ are strictly forbidden. /i̯ u̯/ are written as ⟨y w⟩ if and only if an adjacent phoneme is their corresponding syllabic vowel; otherwise they are written as a tone-3 ı u, as they take tone 3 if permissible, and the same tone as the preceding vowel if not.
All vowels can be "long", but this is typically analyzed as a lack of an onset between two vowels. Nevertheless, there are rules about tones in these situations:

| Starting tone → | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tone 1          | Y   | N   | N   | Y   | N   |
| Tone 2          | Y   | N   | Y   | N   | N   |
| Tone 3          | N   | Y   | Y   | Y   | N   |
| Tone 4          | N   | N   | Y   | N   | Y   |
| Tone 5          | N   | Y   | N   | N   | Y   |

## Phonotactics

### Syllable structure
Matelian is maximally CVF, where F is any continuant. Unlike in e.g. [[Rokadong]], /ɺ/ is not a stop, but that's because it becomes \[l]. However, note that coda fricatives are only allowed at the end of a word, and all coda nasals become /ƞ/ (the whatever nasal), defaulting to \[ɲ ŋ] if the next word starts with a front or back vowel respectively.
### Assimilation
Assimilation only occurs on the whatever nasal, which matches place of articulation with the next consonant.
