Overall, Debazi is a polysynthetic, slightly fusional language with triconsonantal roots. Verbs are incredibly basic overall, noun marking aside, making it unique among Astaryuu conlangs - as they tend to have supremely fucked verbs.
Interestingly, there is no true verb for "to be" - the best equivalent is the suffix *-llah*, which turns adjectives into stative verbs.
## Declensions
Declensions apply to both nouns and verbs, and depend on the number of vowels in the root form of the word. Generally, conjugations will add vowels until a word has at least three of them.
For all of the following, patterns are given such that C is a consonant and V is a vowel. In the basic declension charts, several other letters are used, with different meanings:
* A: a lowered version of the V in the position
* Y: a raised version of the V in the position
* E: a fronted version of the V in the position, usually written as *Vy* - becomes O if frontness is flipped
* O: a backed version of the V in the position, usually written as *Vw* - becomes E if frontness is flipped
* X: no vowel; goes unwritten orthographically in all scripts
### 1 vowel
1-vowel root declensions start with the letter C.
#### C1
C1 declensions have roots of the form CVCC. For nouns, inserted (and mutated) vowels are usually front for syntactical forms (accusative, genitive) and back for positional forms (locative, instrumental). For verbs, all inserted vowels are front.
#### C2
C2 declensions have roots of the form CCVC. Inserted vowels are similar to C1.
#### C3 and C4
C3 and C4 have the same root pattern as C1 and C2 respectively. However, the inserted vowels swap backness levels.
### 2 vowels
2-vowel root declensions start with the letter B.
#### B1
B1 has roots of the form CVCCV. Inserted vowels use the same pattern as C1.
#### B2
B2 has the same inserted vowel pattern pattern as C3, but the same root pattern as B1.
#### B3 and B4
B3 and B4 use the same inserted vowel patterns as B1 and B2 respectively, but have root patterns of the form CVCVC.
#### B5 and B6
B5 and B6 use the same inserted vowel patterns as B1 and B2 respectively, but have root patterns of the form CCVCV.
### 3 vowels
There is only one declension for roots with 3 vowels: A. Declension A roots have the form CVCVCV. No vowels can be inserted, but vowels can be mutated, and these mutations pattern like B1 and C1. This is also why those patterns are number 1, rather than the other inserted vowel pattern.
### Words with more than 3 consonants
If a root has more than 3 consonants in it, the last three consonants (and any vowels between or after them) are the only ones considered for declensions. For example, *rànpagli* "republic" has five consonants. However, the last three consonants have the form CVCCV, so declension B1 is used: *rànpagili* "republican". This is instead of using A due to the three vowels, which would result in \*rànpagli (no inserted vowel).
## Compounding
Compound words often have some of the first word's ending turned into /ʔ/. Usually, this forms a geminate or ejective consonant, as noted in [[Debazi phonology]]. This ends up very similar to Japanese *rendaku*, and would be called *sokudaku* there, but English doesn't have a word for this concept (hence loaning *rendaku* in the first place), so this would probably just be called word-boundary assimilation, as the ending assimilated to its following consonant.
## Nouns
Nouns conjugate for both number and case. Only singular and plural numbers, and nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and instrumental cases, have their own forms. However, Debazi makes heavy use of affixes that effectively apply other cases or numbers:
- The prefix *des-* on the singular form of a noun makes it paucal instead of singular.
- The prefix *t’å-* on the locative form of a noun makes it lative, while *cü-* makes it ablative.
- The *suffix -yya* on a non-genitive noun makes it a construct - that is, it marks that the noun is owned by another. The possessor is the noun conjugated for the same case but without *-yya*.
### A-type conjugations
| Declension A | Singular | Plural |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ |
| Nominative   | VVV      | VVE    |
| Accusative   | VVV      | VYV    |
| Genitive     | VVi      | VYi    |
| Dative       | AVV      | AVE    |
| Locative     | YVO      | YYO    |
| Instrumental | OVV      | OVE    |
If the final V in accusative, dative, and instrumental has no coda (and is not E), then it is replaced with X.
### B-type conjugations
| Declension B1 | Singular | Plural |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Nominative    | VXV      | ViV    |
| Accusative    | VeV      | YeV    |
| Genitive      | VXi      | YXi    |
| Dative        | AXV      | AXE    |
| Locative      | uXO      | uiO    |
| Instrumental  | OXV      | OiV    |
Declensions B3 and B5 mirror Declension B1, but with the placement of the nominative Vs altered (VVX for B3, XVV for B5). All other declensions rearrange in the same way, swapping the middle vowel of B1 with the corresponding vowel.

| Declension B2 | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nominative    | VXV      | VuV    |
| Accusative    | VoV      | YoV    |
| Genitive      | VXu      | YXu    |
| Dative        | AXV      | AXO    |
| Locative      | uXE      | iuE    |
| Instrumental  | OXV      | OuV    |
Declensions B4 and B6 mirror Declension B2, but with the same rearrangement as B3 and B5 respectively.

### C-type conjugations
For all C-type conjugations, a new vowel appears that is, if a capital letter instead of a lowercase letter, based on the V in the nominative (the same if also a V, a fronted copy if E, and a backed copy if O).

| Declension C1 | Singular | Plural |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Nominative    | VXX      | VXi    |
| Accusative    | VXV      | VXE    |
| Genitive      | VXa      | YXe    |
| Dative        | AXX      | AXi    |
| Locative      | YXO      | YXO    |
| Instrumental  | OXi      | OXE    |
Declension C2 mirrors Declension C1, but with all e, i, j, u, w, E, O swapped with o, u, w, i, j, O, E.

| Declension C3 | Singular | Plural |
| ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nominative    | XVX      | XVi    |
| Accusative    | XVV      | XVE    |
| Genitive      | XVa      | XYe    |
| Dative        | XAX      | XAi    |
| Locative      | XYO      | XYO    |
| Instrumental  | XOi      | XOE    |
Declension C4 mirrors Declension C3, but with the same swapped letters as C2.
## Verbs
Verbs mark for person and tense, but the tenses are generally basic unless affixes are involved. However, verbs exhibit polypersonality: they mark for both the person of the subject and the object.
### Personal agreement
The default is to have both the subject and object be in the third person (0 in the below table). The object which is marked here is indirect by default for intransitive verbs, and direct by default for transitive verbs. 

|                 | Object 1sg | Object 1pl | Object 2 | Object 0 |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Subject 1sg** | fwa        | fuya       | fus      | fu       |
| **Subject 1pl** | fyura      | fyu        | fyas     | fya      |
| **Subject 2sg** | saf        | sam        | sas      | sa       |
| **Subject 2pl** | swav       | swam       | swa      | sya      |
| **Subject 0**   | chu        | chi        | cha      | (k’i)    |
The suffix -aŋ can be applied to an intransitive verb, but before any other suffixes, to make it act as a transitive verb. Verbs which are already transitive can become "intransitive" by using the prefix corresponding to a reflexive pronoun (those in the diagonal of the table); this is the only case where the personal prefix *k’i* is used.
Personal prefixes and the suffix -aŋ are never stressed, and so will be subject to mutation in certain environments. Additionally, if the verb starts with /ʔ ʕ/, it mutates to \[ː] when a personal prefix that ends in a continuant is added to it, but its vowel remains dark.
