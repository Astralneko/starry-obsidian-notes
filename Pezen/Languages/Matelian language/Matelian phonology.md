## Consonants
Most Debazi consonants are separated into three types, with different names from native and non-native linguists: "plain/earth", "light/wind", and "dark/fire". 
Dark plosives are glottalized, while dark fricatives are labialized; light plosives and fricatives are both palatalized. Generally, only dark vowels can follow dark consonants, only light vowels can follow light consonants, and only plain vowels can follow plain consonants. However, even though /χ q/ are considered plain, they darken certain vowels - /χ/ darkens back vowels, while /q/ darkens non-back vowels. The plain /θ χ/ use the same light and dark counterparts as /s x/ respectively. 
The light approximants /ɥ j/ and dark approximants /w ʕ/ are unique in that they lighten or darken the preceding vowel, rather than the succeeding one. Lateral approximants, though, are treated like non-approximants, and affect the succeeding vowel; /l/ is plain while /ʟ/ is dark.

### Notes
#### Dialectology
In most dialects, /θ x/ merge when not plain, as shown above. However, in [[Amaril|Amarilian]] Debazi and some other eastern dialects, /θ/ does have light and dark versions: \[θʲ~θɹ θʷ~ɸɹ].
Likewise, in many dialects, including southern-to-western [[West Makhēda|Makhēdan]], [[Asōmdagli|Asōmdaglian]], and northern [[Eramēs|Eramesian]] Debazi, the alveolar stops and fricatives /ts dz s z/ palatalize when before a front vowel (namely /i e/).
The implosive consonants are best described as "slack voiced", rather than fully voiced. 
#### Marginal phonemes
While there is no \[ɮˤ] in the vast majority of dialects, what happened to it varies significantly by region. [[Lamza|Lamzan]] is the only dialect group that includes a significant amount of \[ɮ], and even then, it's an affricated \[dɮ].
/ʔ ʕ/ are only phonemic depending on the analysis of Debazi used. Generally speaking, either one must accept these phonemes or accept that all dark vowels are phonemic. However, these phonemes only have the written phones \[ʔ ʕ] if they are intervocoid or at the beginning or end of a morpheme. Otherwise, they transform plain plosives and fricatives into ejectives, light plosives and fricatives into ejectives either followed or preceded by /j/ (whichever direction has less weight), and anything else that isn't a dark plosives into a geminated version of itself. Adjacent to already-geminated nasals and dark plosives, these sounds are elided entirely. Note that these sounds were already doing this historically, in compound words where one of them was at the boundary, so elision is nothing new - but their vowel in older compound words has since mutated to match the consonant it's now next to.

### Notes
In most words, especially if they are native to Debazi, only the eight plain vowels are phonemic. However, certain analyses may demand other vowels be phonemic.
The harmony seen here is a novel development, so older loans and compounds can be significantly altered by these changes. 
## Phonotactics
### Syllable structure
Debazi syllables are maximally CCVCC. However, there are some limitations on what consonant clusters are allowed. The full CCVCC is only allowed in the final syllable of a morpheme - otherwise, syllables can be maximally CCVC. Most notably, approximants and long nasals cannot be in the onset alongside any other consonant, and ejectives  cannot be in the coda.
Generally, syllabic breaks go before the first least sonorous consonant in a cluster: /amd ask akr atk’/ \[am.d as.k a.kr at.k’]. This is partially to blame for why ejectives cannot be in the coda: they cannot precede a non-sonorant, and even though a sequence like /ak’ŋ/ is allowed, it typically ends up \[a.k’ŋ] or \[ak.kŋ].
Note though, that nasal-fricative clusters phonetically have a stop in them, and so the syllabic break goes before the fricative, even if there is a phonemic plosive afterward: /ansk/ \[an.ᵗsk]. 
### Assimilation
Nasals do *not* assimilate their place of articulation in most Debazi dialects - clusters like /nd/ are allowed, but clusters like /md/ do not merge with them. Likewise, stops do not assimilate after fricatives. However, within the same *native* morpheme, a voiceless plosive cannot follow a nasal, and a plain or light plosive must have the same voicing as a preceding plain fricative. If both the fricative and plosive are plain but have different voicing, the fricative changes voicing when following the plosive. In other words, Debazi can loan clusters like /nt zk ds/, but in dialects where the loan is nativized, the second phoneme is usually voiced anyway.
Nasal-fricative pairs do not assimilate voicing, even in native words. In most dialects, approximants are always voiced, even if adjacent to a voiceless consonant.
### Consonant-vowel harmony
Ideally speaking, a light, plain, or dark vowel has to touch a consonant of the same type. However, not all Debazi words follow this rule, and especially for dark vowels, this harmony is in decline.
Still, Debazi is usually written under the assumption that this harmony is in place, and so writing each of the 22 vowels (or any vowels at all) is unnecessary. However, due to elisions, flattenings, and loanwords, this is not guaranteed. Formal writings, where clarity is most important, sometimes *do* write vowels, but informal writings usually do not.
### Vowel-vowel harmony
Two consecutive vowels of the same non-plain type are not allowed to be the same in almost all dialects of Debazi. This is the main driver of analyses that favor the 22-vowel model. However, the result is usually consistent, where the unstressed vowel becomes "less marked."
The following table lists some examples of how vowels may mutate:

| Stressed vowel | Example equivalent | Word example        |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| æ              | ɛ                  | calay \[tsɛlæj]     |
| eə             | ɜ                  | syekhel \[sʲeəcɕɜl] |
