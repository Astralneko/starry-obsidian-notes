## Palatals
All palatals occur as sequences of an adjacent sound + /j/. However, \[tɕ dʑ ç ɕ ʑ j] occur outside this context, and so are phonemic.

## Diaphonemes
//ɵ ɯ ej ow// are considered diaphonemic, rather than regularly phonemic, in Liðakuin. In the latter two's case, while no known dialect appears to have all of /ej e ɛ/ and all of /ow o ɔ/, the exact results are heavily dialect-dependent. In the former two's case, in the standard dialect of Liðakuin these have merged with other phonemes /ə o/.

# Stress

Liðakuin is a dynamic-accent language. Stressed syllables are louder and longer than non-stressed syllables. Additionally, several of the vowel phonemes are laxened in unstressed syllables.

Stress is unpredictable in Liðakuin, but usually falls on the last "long" vowel, specifically one of /æ aj e ej o ow i ʏɥ/.

Liðakuin speakers also tend to reduce the vowels /a i y u ʏɥ e ei o ou/ to \[ɐ ɪ ʏ ʊ ʉ ɛ e ɔ o] when unstressed. This results in /e ɛ/ and /o ɔ/ to be merged in unstressed position. Some [[dialects of Liðakuin]] do this even in stressed position, referred to as the *sehn*-*rénn* merger.

### Phonotactics

The maximal syllable structure in Liðakuin is CCVCC. Liðakuin generally abhors hiatus that does not occur at word boundaries - that is, within the same word, two vowels are not allowed to touch, and compounded words or affixed words that would result in two vowels touching frequently have a consonant inserted between them, such as a sonorant or the otherwise non-phonemic glottal stop. This inserted consonant is epenthetic and is rarely written orthographically, and is also one of the key differences between different [[dialects of Liðakuin]].
