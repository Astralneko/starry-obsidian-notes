## Morphology

### Nouns
Root noun morphemes are usually one to three syllables long. There are many derivational affixes in Rokadong as well, including but not limited to:
* *jan-* - instrument of the root (occasionally also fills the role of *-sona*)
* *-sona* - actor or someone characterized by the root
* *vota-* - collectivity, similarity, instrument of the root
* *-an* - object or place characterized by the root (occasionally also fills the role of *vota-*)
* *i(t)-*/*-(k)il* - quality or abstraction of the root, often used to derive adjectives
* *fen-*/*fer-* - abstraction, place (especially with *-an*), goal, or result

Nouns do not decline for gender. In fact, many Rokadong nouns for animals or people do not have a natural gender by default, especially for native words. Nouns also do not decline for plurality, using numerals instead if context demands it. Full reduplication, or numeral-like determiners like *unya* and *tékuha*, could also be used to pluralize. However, full reduplication does not always result in a plural word.

### Pronouns
*See also [[Rokadong pronouns]].*

As one of the most widely spoken Nentan languages alongside [[Imperial Karanesa]], Rokadong has a wide range of pronouns. However, most dialects only use a fraction of the total number of pronouns.
### Particles
Particles generally are applied to nouns. An unmarked noun is said to be in the direct case - as Rokadong uses Austronesian alignment, both the agent and object of a verb may be unmarked if it is syntactically redundant. The other cases are marked by a particle preceding the noun (and its measure word and numeral, if present):

* Genitive *to*, used for possession, apposition, origin, reference, and description
* Ergative *ká*, used for the agent of a verb
* Accusative *pá*, used for the patient (direct object) of a verb
* Locative and instrumental *gun*, used for the location of a verb and the means by which it was performed
* Dative *laki*, used for the indirect object or the benefactor of a verb

These particles become prefix-like proclitics when they apply to pronouns, with *gun* and *laki* shortening to *gu* and *la*. However, they could be considered proclitics in all cases, as they frequently are pronounced as if they are prefixes, especially given that outside of careful pronunciation, the final vowel of these case particles replaces the starting vowel of nouns that start with /a/.
### Verbs
Generally speaking, verbs are treated as if they were verbalized nouns, which in many cases, is etymologically the case. However, there are some morphological features unique to verbs.

Verbs often are the longest words in Rokadong, owing to the large number of agglutinative affixes that can be applied simultaneously. Often, nouns and adjectives can be formed from these affixes by removing the final  *r(a)* in the word. For example,  *matar* ("to scare"), like most emotion words in general, can be turned into  *tenamata* ("scary") and  *anmata* ("scared") using the causative and continuous aspect affixes respectively.

The four main types of verb affix are tense, aspect, mood, and voice. Rokadong recognizes five tenses - remote past, past, present, future, and remote future. There are also six aspects - perfective, habitual, causative, continuous, semelfactive, and accidental. An unmarked verb is assumed to be in present perfective - there is no infinitive form.

The remote future tense is very rare for its intended purpose, and more commonly refers to verbs that are hypothetical or subjunctive. The other two moods that have affixes are imperative and conditional, but unlike the hypothetical, these two also replace the . The hypothetical mood is sometimes used as a general subjunctive, but sometimes a helping *minar* is used instead. Likewise, some dialects eschew the remote future ending entirely, using *-min* (from *minar*) for the hypothetical.

Many verb affixes are affected by the stem they apply to, and this can be dialect-dependent. For example, the causative affix *tena-* is usually shortened to *ten-* if the stem begins with a vowel or a nasal consonant. In Ahoteláh Rokadong, this also occurs when the stem begins with a plosive.

For verbs, reduplication does not pluralize the verb, but it does intensify the action the verb represents. In the extreme case,  *rulurukr* ("to sprint, to move at top speed") is a reduplication of  *lurukr* ("to run"), which is a reduplication of  *rukr* ("to walk").

## Syntax
### Constituent order
In transitive sentences, Rokadong tends to place the agent before the verb and the objects after the verb. However, Rokadong does not have a subject in the Indo-European sense, so this word order is notated "AVO" rather than "SVO". Additionally, the verb can be moved from *agent trigger* into *patient trigger* with the prefix *ká*. Both the agent and direct object can also be marked individually as such with *ká* and *pá* respectively. As a result, the word order of Rokadong is relatively free, though AVO is the most common word order, although OVA is common too, and VAO is rare but not unheard of. The first of the three is the topic of the sentence.

### Noun phrase
Adjectives and determiners follow the noun they apply to. Much as in the natural language Spanish, numerals are often considered adjectives, but are placed before the noun, rather than after it. This means that even though *tékuha* and *unya* express an amount of something, they are determiners and not numerals, as they follow the noun. Prepositions and case particles precede the noun they apply to.

When placed in the genitive, a noun is considered an adjective, and is placed after the noun it applies to. That is, the phrase "cup of sugar" translates to *ruhung to kairi*, not *kairi to ruhung*.

### Verb phrase
Adverbs are considered a form of adjective, and follow the verb they apply to. However, unlike adjectives, adverbs take on the same tense affix as the verb they apply to. This is likely a holdover from when all adjectives were stative verbs.
