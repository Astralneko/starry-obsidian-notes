Inspollian is a sister language to Linnerian. With how Drawn to AfterLife is written, Linnerian is mostly inferred, but Inspollian is actually written.

# Phonology
Consonants:
/ɱ n ɲ ŋ p b t d cç ɟʝ k ɡ s z ʃ ʒ l ʎ j w r/
\<m n ny ng p b t d cy gy c g s z si zi l ly y w r>

Vowels:
/i e eː u o oː ɐ/
\<i e ey u o ow a>

This opposes Linnerian, whose \<ea ou> turn into /ʲa ɐw/ instead of /e o/.

/o/ is always long before /l ʎ/ and after /ʃ ʒ/. /e/ is not allowed, long or short, after /cç ɟʝ/, and examples of such turn into /ɐ/.

In some dialects, final /l/ is also morphed into \[ɐ̯].
