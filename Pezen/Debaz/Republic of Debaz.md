See [the wiki article](https://arcadianodyssey.miraheze.org/wiki/Debaz) for this one, just to make sure all information from there is also on here at all times.

The **Republic of Debaz** ([[Pezen/Debaz/Debazi language/Debazi|Debazi]]: \[dɛbadz, -dʒ]), often referred to simply as **Debaz**, is a country in western [[Mangell]]. A superpower of modern [[Pezen]], Debaz is known for being the "Nation of Roads", and fittingly, is one end of the [[Transpezenian Channel]].
## History
The Republic of Debaz began as a political merger of several of the historic kingdoms of ancient Munkai. One of these kingdoms formed into a republic after the [[Makhēdan Revolution]], which caused a chain reaction across what is now "core Debaz" in the modern day. Debaz grew to its current size by variously causing and taking advantage of riots in several kingdoms near Makhēda. The last province to be added was [[Serayyah]], 185 years before present. However, the [[Lūtàbax|Holy City of Lūtàbax]] has since seceded, 64 years prior to the present. Ironically, this move was favored by the Senate of Debaz, because Lūtàbax City itself, being a holy city, caused Debaz public perception issues with regard to secularity in the Senate.
