The **Rokaselan calendar** is the timekeeping system used by the [Rauratoshan Kingdom](https://arcadianodyssey.miraheze.org/wiki/Rauratoshan_Kingdom?action=edit&redlink=1 "Rauratoshan Kingdom (page does not exist)").
## Mechanics
There are two core versions of the Rokaselan calendar: the main calendar, and the divine calendar. The divine calendar is used as well, but only as a reference for durations.
### Main
The Rokaselan calendar separates each month into 12 months. The first six months have 31 days, and the last six months have 30 days. However, the last day of the 12th month is only included if the number of days between vernal equinoxes is 366. This is done using a set of 29 and 33 year cycles, so that 1 Sairairita (an auspicious and important day) is predictable.
Years are named based on the currently ruling "dynasty." A word that references the dynasty is chosen by the first monarch to rule in the dynasty. This word may be changed as well, regardless of if a new ruling family takes the throne. The current dynasty as of Gregorian year 2025 is referred to as "Kanata", chosen by [[King Irirusta II]] when his family, House Mohito, rose to power in Gregorian year 1925. Before those are the dynasties Peska and Dúrisa, which were held by the same family, but the years leading up to Peska 1 were seen as a turning point in the straits of Rauratoshan after the fall of the [[Empire of Karan]], hence the change in name.
Regardless of the name used, the year number is treated as an ordinal number - that is, "100(th year of) Kanata" or "2438(th) cycle year". Therefore, it typically ends with some variant of  _-sha_. The Gregorian dates in the below table assume that the beginning of Drawn to AfterLife takes place in February 2025, a safe assumption based on the Gregorian-adjacent Shadaric calendar.

| Era       | Start date |         | End date  |         |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Remuymaga | 817 AD     | 1220 MK | 1223 AD   | 1636 MK |
| Kagyuha   | 1223 AD    | 1637 MK | 1295 AD   | 1708 MK |
| Karlan    | 1295 AD    | 1709 MK | 1611 AD   | 2024 MK |
| Dúrisa    | 1611 AD    | 2025 MK | 1786 AD   | 2198 MK |
| Peska     | 1786 AD    | 2199 MK | 1926 AD   | 2338 MK |
| Kanata    | 1926 AD    | 2339 MK | _ongoing_ |         |
The epoch of the Rokaselan calendar is 2436 years before the present of [[Drawn to AfterLife]]; this is referred to as "1 MK" (where MS stands for "misha kótan" or "cycle year"), and supposedly is named for when the royal regalia of Rauratoshan were gifted to the first king, despite that the name implies the creation of the world in [[Yukacan]], which occurred well before that.
### Modified
The modified Rokaselan calendar only differs from the original in the placement of leap years. The modified Rokaselan calendar uses the same leap years as the Gregorian calendar. This does not see use in Drawn to Afterlife, and its existence is not confirmed there. However, this modified Rokaselan calendar does see use in other properties that include the Rokaselan calendar.
### Divine
The divine calendar is the earliest version of the Rokaselan calendar, said to be given to the kingdom by Selshan themselves. It uses a strict 360-day year, separating each 30-day month into five 6-day weeks. In Rokasela, it is expected that birth certificates and building deeds list the date of construction in the divine calendar.
