The **Shadaric city-states** are a group of micro-states in northern [[Graphine]]. They are member states of the [[Rudafian Alliance]], and were formerly economically united under the [[Shadaric Bank]]. Correspondingly, the region of [[Graphine]] where these states are found is referred to as **Shadar**.
They are also linguistically related, as all states speak one of the [[Shadaric languages]].

## Politics
The name "Shadaric city-states" is a slight misnomer for this group, as a state may be comprised of multiple settlements. However, as most large cities of the Shadar region are independent of all other cities, the name is still used.
A state such as [[Daman]] is typically comprised of one large city - in this case, [[Condero]] - and its surrounding villages and smaller towns.
All Shadaric city-states are members of the [[Rudafian Alliance]]. However, their economic ties go much farther back. Shadaric city-states are said to economically act as one unit. Trade between them is extensive, as the vast majority of states could not economically function in an isolated environment. However, all Shadaric city-states are socio-politically sovereign, with agreements between cities treated like treaties between nations. While it is extremely common for treaties with powers outside of Shadar to be carried across all city-states, this is ''de jure'' determined on a per-city basis.
## History
Long ago, possibly before the era of Classical Nenta, there was one state that ruled over the entire region of Shadar. Much of the details have been lost to the sands of time, as while late Shadaric writings have been recovered, writings dry up almost entirely between then and the present.
What is known is that the united nation of Shadar fell to a cataclysmic event about 1,500 years ago. It is assumed to be the result of a [[Odafia eruption|highly-explosive volcanic explosion]] on the largest of the [[Matte Islands]], [[Odafia Island]], as documents from around the world at the time period document a "lack of summer", "smoky skies", and other elements of a volcanic winter, for several years. A diary written by an early [[Yukacan]] monk documents a tremendous thunderclap in clear skies on the presumed day of the incident, 30 Towanrita of the year {{roka-calendar|929}}. This devastated Shadar, destroying the political structure of the region.
1,000 years ago, the region of Shadar began to recover, but in a unique way, as each region of Shadar rose at about the same rate, resulting in a collection of micro-states, such as [[Condero]], [[Bixena]], and [[Lindae]]. This is referred to as the "Shadaric rebirth". In the year corresponding to the [[Rokaselan calendar]] year 1442, the epoch of the [[Shadaric calendar]] was set to be 500 years prior, an estimate of the time since Shadar collapsed; this declaration marks the formal beginning of the Shadaric rebirth, even though it had been going on for about a century beforehand, and would continue for about a century afterward. Most of the cities that rose during this time still exist, and are referred to as "phoenix cities" for it. Lindae in particular dates its political history directly to this time period, with about 9 centuries of council minutes stored in the Library of Lindae. The epoch of the current era of the Shadaric calendar marks the year that the [[Council of Lindae]] first met, by their estimation.
These micro-states got into frequent conflicts over resources. Particularly notable is the "[[Century of Strife]]", where almost every state was destroyed, absorbed, or otherwise had its ties to the rebirth of Shadar muddled. This resulted in unstable nations and laws. To end the trouble, four mayors got together and formed the [[Shadaric Bank]], which would be in charge of economics and distribution across Shadar. However, the Shadaric city-states would not receive this support from any member city if they continued to be in active conflict. This effectively froze the political state of the region until the present day, barring some skirmishes over borders.
