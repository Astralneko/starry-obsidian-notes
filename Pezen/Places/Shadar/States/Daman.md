**Daman**, formally the **Shire of Daman** ([[Linnerian]]: *Arcon ea Daman* /ɑð̞kɔn e ɾɑmɑn), is one of the [[Shadaric city-states|Shadaric city-states]]. 

## Etymology
Doylistically, "Daman" is a play on the phrase "the man", which generally refers to the government (pejoratively). In-universe, Daman is derived from the name of one of the founding fathers of the eponyomous Family, Teiro Daman (/teð̞ɔ dɑmɑn/).

## Geography
The Shire of Daman refers to the capital city of [[Condero]], the port town [[Mea Cunia]], and the surrounding area, including several smaller villages. This area is mostly grassland, flat near the coast and hilly away from the coast. The area southeast of Condero is more densely packed with trees.

## Politics
Daman is ruled by the [[Family of Daman]]. In spite of the name, the Family of Daman is not a monarchy, as members are not related, but see themselves as a family as linked as one formed through blood. In this respect, the Family of Daman more closely resembles a mafia than a royal family. Only elders of the Family of Daman may choose new recruits, though it's expected that the children of Family members will more likely than not be accepted.
