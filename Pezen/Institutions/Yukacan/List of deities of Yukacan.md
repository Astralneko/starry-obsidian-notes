The **pantheon of Yukacan** is rather large, with many tiers of spirits included.

## Spirit types

Yukacan recognizes three types of spirit: the living, the material, and the divine. A spirit can be "sealed/hidden" or "visible/unbound"; sometimes, sealed deities are considered a fourth class, the "hidden" spirit. Divine and hidden spirits are classed together as "deities", but Yukacan ascribes similar traits to all spirits; the main difference is in scope.

Living spirits are souls born when a living being is born, material spirits are connected to the land in some way (such as to a home or physical landmark), divine spirits are connected to the building blocks of land or other such concepts, and titanic spirits are deceased or sealed divine spirits. All of the above are seen as indestructible to physical phenomena. For example, when a living being's body dies, its spirit is said not to die, but to ascend to one or another spiritual realm.

Divine spirits are not just divided into "hidden" and "visible", but also are divided into "yukazetta" ("war deities") and "yukahushata" ("peace deities").

Seeing as firstly, there are too many to name in a reasonable timeframe, and secondly, they are typically not translated as "deities", the first two classes will be ignored for the list of deities of Yukacan. For lists of them, check census or geographical data.

The guide of the world, Selshan is said to ensure the good fortune of the earth and those who live on it. The [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "w:Milky Way") was purportedly repainted by Selshan. Although considered a _yukahushata_, their extended title is said to have come from the areas they had to conquer to calm the world, and they will continue to fight if needed to protect and guide kanvakind.
