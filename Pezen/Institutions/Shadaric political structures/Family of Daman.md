The **Family of Daman** are the rulers of the [[Daman|Shire of Daman]].
In spite of the name, the Family of Daman is not a monarchy, as members are not related, but see themselves as a family as linked as one formed through blood. In this respect, the Family of Daman more closely resembles a mafia than a royal family.
## Induction
Only elders of the Family of Daman may choose new recruits, though it's expected that the children of Family members will more likely than not be accepted. This is usually referred to as incumbency, as those in the same clan, so to speak, retain power. Generally, such NOT occurring is often caused by a scandal, like with [[Nephrite Constellation|Charon and Hatena]]'s father [[Osciu Mirai]]. He was not allowed to join even though [[Koerai Mirai|his own grandfather]] was a huge donor toward buying the Family of Daman's main meeting spot, the [[Messa soe Daman]]. Osciu applied to join, but was found to be cheating on his wife at the time with another Family member, [[Reaca Mirai]] (née Serafena), and so was not allowed to do so.
Note in this case, though, that partially because they weren't conceived at the time, and partially because the mother was allowed to continue being in the Family, his children wouldn't necessarily face the same issues. [[Nephrite Constellation|Their mysterious older sibling]] is said to have done this, but all Family members who have supposedly met them only have vague memories of them.
## Prominent members
* [[Reaca Mirai]]
* [[Gesta Demantea]], his wife, and his oldest son
