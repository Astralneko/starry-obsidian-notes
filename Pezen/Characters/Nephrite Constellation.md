The **Nephrite Constellation** is a set of spirits in *Drawn to AfterLife* who, together among them, only have one "life-swatch", despite being separate spirits. They are also referred to as "the siblings of Mirai", in reference to the clan to which they belong, and the scarves each wear that are a key part of the clan's wealth.
# Real-world meaning
In general, the Nephrite Constellation is a magical version of a system. It is of note that in-universe, although this is notable, it is not weird. Other forms of plurality are shown in-text, such as Rokaselan spiritspeakers, so although this representation can be, in some ways, stereotypical, it is explicitly not the only allowed representation.
# Members
## Hatena
Hatena is the first member of the Constellation to be introduced, with her so-called death in the prologue. In life, she worked at a local restaurant, mixing drinks and talking with guests. Her skill at communication and sizing people up at a glance was honed by this career.
## Charon
Charon is the first point of view character in Drawn to AfterLife. At the start of the story, he is grieving the loss of his sister Hatena. As a messenger, he also makes contact with many in Condero. In the inverse to Hatena though, he doesn't talk much, if at all, with his clients. Instead, he tends to find himself in his own world at work.

# Trivia
* Mirai is Japanese for "future". However, each of the members of the Nephrite Constellation has a notable name too:
	*  Hatena: Originates from a Japanese likely-pun meaning "at the end" - whence "future's end," because she dies at the beginning of Drawn to AfterLife.
	* Charon: The Greek ferryman of the dead. Charon Mirai takes it upon himself to carry the other spirits on his back, as their protector.
