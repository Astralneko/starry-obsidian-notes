The **Nephrite Constellation** is a set of spirits in *Drawn to AfterLife* who, together among them, only have one "life-swatch", despite being separate spirits. They are also referred to as "the siblings of Mirai", in reference to the clan to which they belong, and the [[Eternal Jade Scarf]] each wears, that are a key part of the clan's wealth.

Mechanically, as DTAL was first created to potentially be a video game project, the Nephrite Constellation was intended to represent a jack-of-all-trades type, able to slot into any build.
# History
Fénon Mirai was born to [[Reaca Mirai|Reaca]] and [[Osciu Mirai|Osciu]] on the 7th day of the Month of Hearth, 1474. However, she would die at the age of 14. Distraught, Reaca decided to activate the [[Eternal Jade Scarf]], which revitalized Fénon's lifeswatch, but split it into two pieces: Charon and Hatena.

According to the initial memories of the newly-created entities, Charon and Hatena were always the children of Reaca Mirai, though she started to leave more often, not wanting to tell of what she had done. Other than Reaca, those who spent more time around the two of them started to have their memories overwritten too, until all Condero treated Fénon as a misremembering.

Hatena's death in the Month of Beginnings 1495 is the inciting incident for the plot of *Drawn to AfterLife*. Charon mended the scarf between her death and her funeral, which to him was carrying a piece of Hatena with him - this caused the spell to further malfunction, splitting Charon's own lifeswatch between himself, Hatena, and two other spirits.
# Real-world meaning
In general, the Nephrite Constellation is a magical version of a system. It is of note that in-universe, although this is notable, it is not weird. Other forms of plurality are shown in-text, such as Rokaselan spiritspeakers, so although this representation can be, in some ways, stereotypical, it is explicitly not the only allowed representation.
# Members
## Hatena
Hatena is the first member of the Constellation to be introduced, with her so-called death in the prologue. In life, she worked at a local restaurant, mixing drinks and talking with guests. Her skill at communication and sizing people up at a glance was honed by this career.
For combat, Hatena's thing is twin daggers, though she also uses magic to buff herself.
## Charon
Charon is the first point of view character in Drawn to AfterLife. At the start of the story, he is grieving the loss of his sister Hatena. As a messenger, he also makes contact with many in Condero. In the inverse to Hatena though, he doesn't talk much, if at all, with his clients. Instead, he tends to find himself in his own world at work.
Charon typically doesn't leave Condero, where he can likely yell for guards if needed, but if he does, he is armed in case of monsters: a one-handed sword imbued with wind magic to strengthen its swings and create a blast of air when striking something, and a one-handed shield.
## Lova
Lova represents Fénon before their untimely death; Lova uses exclusively she/her pronouns, much as Fénon did when they were alive. These memories were locked away within Hatena, until Hatena's death resulted in fracturing the Nephrite Constellation even further.
Lova is the most magic-oriented of the four, what with her resembling tropes of the magical girl genre; she only has a knife for non-magical combat.
## Léthe/Fénon
After the restitching, Léthe resurfaces, as "that which was forgotten," intended to represent Fénon as if time did not freeze for them. However, Léthe presents as male, taking on a personality similar to early-chapter Charon, who was carrying his memories. Léthe holds the true memories, that Fénon existed, but thinks that which is dead should lay forgotten, and has blocked himself, and thus the others, from remembering.
As a ranger, Léthe's proficiency is with a shotgun.
# Trivia
* Mirai is Japanese for "future". However, each of the members of the Nephrite Constellation has a notable name too:
	* Hatena: Originates from a Japanese likely pun meaning "at the end" - whence "future's end." Hatena's death serves as the onset of the story and a red herring for the true nature of the Nephrite Constellation.
	* Charon: The Greek ferryman of the dead. Charon Mirai takes it upon himself to carry the other spirits on his back, as their protector.
	* Lova: Norwegian for "promise(d)", ergo "promised future," that which was given to Fénon Mirai after their death. Similarity to the English word "love" are unintentional but reasonable.
	* Léthe: Λήθη *Léthe* is the river of the Greek underworld that borders Elysium, named for forgetting and oblivion.
	* Fénon: From Ancient Greek φαίνων *phaínon* "shining" (pronounced /fenon/ before its deprecation/displacement by the passive), which is also an Ancient Greek name for the planet Saturn (modern uses Κρόνος), the last regularly visible planet of the Solar System.
* The Nephrite Constellation as a whole uses chiefly green magic (wind spells, nature spells, healing magic), as a way to mechanically link them together.
