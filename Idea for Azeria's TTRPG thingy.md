Base "Meditate" - For their action, the bearer may spend Resolve to recover Vitality or Mana.

L1 "Mind over Matter" - When the Monk uses a Phys skill, they may, for 2 Energy or 2 Resolve, alter its pool to Res.

M1 "Follow-Through" - If being attacked with a Pummeling attack, the Monk may, as a reaction, spend 1 Energy per 3 Energy the attacker used on their turn. Both must then make an Acrobatics check; if the attacker's result is less than the Monk's result, then the Monk takes no damage. If the attacker moved in the same turn, they move an additional 10 feet in a direction chosen by the Monk.

R1 "Bread and Butter" - The Monk may spend 2 additional Energy when using a Pummeling attack. If they do so, they use the attack twice.

L2 "Matter over Mind" - Gain Phys Resistance, but Res Weakness.

L3 "Memetic Form" - For 12 Energy, you may summon a "Sprite" if they are not out. For 8 Energy, you may depart the Sprite if they are out. The Sprite and source share pools, but while the Sprite is out, it has Phys Immunity and its source has Res Immunity; this overwrites the effect of "Physical Perseverance" if present.
The source can still spend Resolve, but cannot use skills whose pool is Res. Though Phys skills can still be used by the Sprite, their pool becomes Res, and their element becomes Force if their element was Phys-aligned (Pummeling, Smashing, Impact, Piercing, Slashing, or Chopping).
