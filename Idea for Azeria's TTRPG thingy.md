Base "Meditate" - For their action, the bearer may spend Resolve to recover Vitality or Mana.

L1 "Mind over Matter" - When the Monk uses a Phys skill, they may, for 2 Energy or 2 Resolve, alter its pool to Res.

M1 "Follow-Through" - If being attacked with a Pummeling attack, the Monk may, as a reaction, spend 1 Energy per 3 Energy the attacker used on their turn. Both must then make an Acrobatics check; if the attacker's result is less than the Monk's result, then the Monk takes no damage. If the attacker moved in the same turn, they move an additional 10 feet in a direction chosen by the Monk.

R1 "Bread and Butter" - The Monk may spend 2 additional Energy when using a Pummeling attack. If they do so, they use the attack twice.

L2 "Matter over Mind" - Gain Phys Resistance, but Res Weakness.

L3 "Memetic Form" - For 12 Energy, you may summon a "Sprite" if they are not out. For 8 Energy, you may depart the Sprite if they are out. The Sprite and source share pools, but while the Sprite is out, it has Phys Immunity and its source has Res Immunity; this overwrites the effect of "Physical Perseverance" if present.
The source can still spend Resolve, but cannot use skills whose pool is Res. Though Phys skills can still be used by the Sprite, their pool becomes Res, and their element becomes Force if their element was Phys-aligned (Pummeling, Smashing, Impact, Piercing, Slashing, or Chopping).

Base "Animal Connection" - Once per Recollection, outside of combat, you may search for a Common or Elemental Beast or Monster in the area the Tamer is currently in; the Tamer and the beast or monster in question roll Persuasion, and if the Tamer's result is higher, they can choose to make the beast or monster replace their available tamed creature. If they do not succeed or the Tamer does not make, what the beast or monster does is up to the DM.
Tamed creatures can be summoned or recalled in combat for the Tamer's action. The Tamer controls the tamed creature by default, and the tamed creature ranks up alongside the Tamer. Depending on the DM, you may be allowed to start with a tamed creature, but it is recommended not to circumvent "Speak to the Trees/Dead/Myths" with this.

L1 "Fortify Spirit" - Magi:Earth skill. For 8 Energy, you may choose to either give you or your summon a +50% buff to Fortitude until the end of the turn, or a 

M1 "Call Spirit" - Reso:Sonic skill. For 3 Energy and the Tamer's action, they can call to their tamed creature as long as they're within 60 feet of them, giving them a +25% buff to their Strength and Will until the creature's 2nd action after using this skill. This will not stack if used multiple times in a row.

R1 "Drain Spirit" - Magi:Decay attack. For 6 Energy and 2 Mana, deal damage equal to Spell Power and recover Vitality for either the Tamer or their summon equal to half the damage dealt, rounded up.

LL2 "Speak to the Trees" - "Animal Connection" can also be used on minor Natura and Celestia.

RR2 "Speak to the Dead" - "Animal Connection" can also be used on minor Undead and Spirits.

Ultimate "Speak to the Myths" - "Animal Connection" can also be used on Dragons. All Magi-pool attacks deal double damage to Mythica enemies.
