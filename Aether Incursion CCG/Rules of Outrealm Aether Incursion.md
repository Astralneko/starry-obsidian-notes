Players are referred to as "Summoners" for the purposes of this document.
# Game Procedures
## Start of Game
1. Each summoner shuffles their deck and draws 7 cards.
2. If either summoner does not have a card in their starting hand that can be played on turn 1, they can discard their hand, shuffle again, and draw 7 cards. This can be done up to twice.
3. Select a summoner to go first by some metric. Since some game mechanics may require a d6 or two, feel free to use these to select. They then take their first turn. See "One Turn" section.
4. On each summoner's first turn of the game, all effects which lower player health do nothing. Raising player health is allowed, though.
5. After the first summoner's turn, the second one gets to take a turn, and so on until an end state is reached. See "End States section."
## One Turn
The following steps are taken in order during a summoner's turn:
1. Draw Phase - Draw a card from your deck. If there are no cards to draw when you reach this phase, you lose unless card mechanics allow you to refill your deck or play from an empty deck.
2. Main Phase - This phase consists of any non-combat actions the summoner wishes to take that turn. The summoner can summon (play) one Spirit Card to the field per turn, but if the effect of a card tells them to do so, any number can be summoned per turn. Any number of Basic Spell Cards and Basic Item Cards can be used per turn, but unless the card says otherwise, only one Special Spell Card and Special Item Card can be used per turn.
