The Bio-Assessment Survey Squad, or BASS (like the fish) for short, is a scientific study group based in [[Newsprint City]]. Their focus is on the lifeforms of Earth. It is headed by [[Grendel]].
# Achievements
The crowning achievement of the BASS is the so-called Chimera Project. Inspired by possibly-fictional records contained in Alterna's history logs, the BASS has created fusions of different lifeforms in the Splatoon world. Several of these are sapient, resulting in the NPA Chimeras, so called because they are named in birth order after the [[NEPO Phonetic Alphabet]].
## List of known chimeras
