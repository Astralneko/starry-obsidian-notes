The Bio-Assessment Survey Squad, or BASS (like the fish) for short, is a scientific study group based in [[Newsprint City]]. Their focus is on the lifeforms of Earth. It is headed by [[Grendel]].
# Achievements
Although the BASS primarily makes medical products, including innovations regarding the spawn platforms of Newsprint City, it is most well-known for running the [[Newsprint City Garden]] and the Chimera Project. The Newsprint City Garden is next to the [[Prison Plains]], and cares for plants and the bugs that enjoy them.

The crowning achievement of the BASS is the so-called Chimera Project. Inspired by possibly-fictional records contained in human history logs, the BASS has created fusions of different lifeforms in the Splatoon world. Unlike its inspiration, BASS "chimeras" are typically grown from embryos in vitro, rather than a sci-fi retroviral treatment. The "holy grail" of the BASS is to create a form of Great Zapfish that produces even more electrical power, but this has not been accomplished yet.

Several of these chimeras are sapient, resulting in the NPA Chimeras, so called because they are named in birth order after the [[NEPO Phonetic Alphabet]].
## List of known chimeras
Note: Due to their relative commonness, salmonid hybrids with any of the classic inkfish are referred to as "salmonlings".

[[Bermuda]] - calico cat zapling
[[Eire]] - stinger salmonling (ray?)
[[Izu-oshima]] - sea butterfly octoling
[[Java]] - steel eel salmonling (octopus)
[[Molokai]] - shark octoling
[[Oyakoba]] - scrapper salmonling (squid)
[[Pompeii]] - nudibranch inkling
[[Roanoke]] - lurrikai 
[[Yuzhny]] - flipper-flopper salmonling (squid)
