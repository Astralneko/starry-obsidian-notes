**Olympia Tower** is the tallest building in [[Newsprint City]]. Based on, but not directly derived from, the One World Trade Center, Olympia Tower is a 2,048-foot skyscraper topped with a giant model globe. The model globe is ringed by the Ring of Earth, an observation platform used for the Newsprint Herald news broadcasts, as well as the New Year Splatcast.

The Olympia Tower is directly adjacent to the [[Newsprint Highway]].

There is also an observation deck on the 60th floor that is open at all times (unlike the Ring of Earth), and has a retractible glass dome for protection from the rain.

The tower is ringed by multiple layers of solar panels to supplement the city's power grid. Additionally, below the tower is an aquarium of zapfish.
