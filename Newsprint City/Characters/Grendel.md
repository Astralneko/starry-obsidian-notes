**Grendel** is an inkling scientist, and the leader of the [[Bio-Assessment Survey Squad]].

He styles himself as "the leader of radical equality", calling to raise the non-inkling races' standard of living to that of the inklings. Multiple of his underlings, such as [[Oyakoba]] and [[Yuzhny]], wholeheartedly believe this message, but others who know him, like [[Izu-oshima]] and ultimately [[Ayakashi]], see it as the façade it ultimately is: equalization, rather than tolerance.
# Trivia
* Grendel is named after the antagonist of the first part of *Beowulf*. Like the inkling, the *Beowulf* Grendel is often described as a giant (though the source character's species is not actually confirmed), though unlike the troll, the *Eternal Thunderstorm* Grendel works by cunning and building an image, although his rage is evident as the Copper Splatoon's investigation uncovers his abuse of power.
