## Trailblaze
There are three directions on the compass of destiny — the Unknown, the Known, and the Unknowable. We can tolerate the Unknown, but will never bow to the Unknowable. The Trailblazer is one who values connection.

The Trailblaze was confirmed by 3.7 to have been absorbed by the Finality.
### Akivili
Akivili was a human from Pegana that presumably built the Astral Express. The Astral Express still uses Pegana's year as the basis of its own calendar, even though they frequently deal with the IPC and Pegana seems to no longer exist.
### Emanators
Mikhail is not a confirmed Emanator, but, he fits the description to some degree. He helped free Asdana, referred to as Penacony by both natives and IPC representatives, from IPC rule. Mikhail is not confirmed to be an Emanator directly, but generally speaking, only Emanators have the ability to revive without the Abundance, as Mikhail did through Misha.
## Destruction
The birth of the universe is a mistake. If civilization is a cancer emerging quietly from the boundless stars, then war is the only common language known to all intelligent life. Reckless action is the easiest to understand, and so is the best.
### Nanook
Nanook the Destruction ascended to Aeonhood in a blaze of fury that destroyed THEIR home star system of Adlivun. Adlivun is named after the spirits that inhabit the Inuktitut underworld, and Nanook's name comes from the same real-world language. 

Interestingly, Zandar One Kuwabara, creator of the Erudition, also comes from this planet, and his fragment Lygus asks to be taken there after the events of Amphoreus's main quest.
### Emanators
Lord Ravagers of the Destruction embody other paths, trying to turn them toward the Destruction. The Erudition is already equivalent to the Destruction, as its Lord Ravager (Irontomb) coincidentally proved that almost every other Path leads to Destruction, proving that every other Path can have a Lord Ravager.

Irontomb forced Nous to reset its eternal extrapolations and alone destroyed a significant portion of the known universe. \[NeiKos496] Khaslana, whilst still a non-physical line of code, broke into Path Space, fought fellow Lord Ravager Zephyro (without either party dying), and cut Nanook THEMSELF, drawing THEIR ichor. Emanators of the Destruction thus are proven to be powerful even in comparison to other Emanators. (Khaslana is not stated to be an Emanator, but it's generally held as true that only Emanators can do that kind of thing.)
## The Hunt
The cost of the hunt is not a consideration. Determined and decisive action is the key to achieving one's goals.
### Lan
Lan is based on a centaur. Lan relentlessly fights THEIR enemies, regardless of who gets caught in the crossfire. Of course, because these generally mean Yaoshi and Nanook, not THAT many are opposed, but notable among them is THEIR Emanator, Feixiao, who wishes to hunt Lan down for refusing to rescue foxians in THEIR hunt against the borisin.
### Emanators
Like Khaslana and Mikhail, Feixiao is not a confirmed Emanator, but she's treated similarly to Acheron (a confirmed Emanator), so I'll include her, especially since she proves that the Hunt is also self-destructive, like the Erudition and Destruction.
## Erudition
All things bear unanswered questions, and there is an answer to everything. Understanding of the universe is paramount. Inquisition and strong logical faculty are the most valuable traits to possess.
### Nous
Nous the Erudition was created by Zandar and caused the universe to become ultimately predictable - or did it? Herta's Solitary Waves Theory says otherwise. Then again, Nous provided the baseline equation...
### Emanators and other Paths
The Erudition seems to be linked to almost every other path, but ESPECIALLY the Destruction, Trailblaze, and Finality.

Two of the three known Emanators of the Erudition created entire Aeons: Dr. Primitive created Device IX, and Zandar One Kuwabara created Nous THEMSELF. However, I'd argue that Zandar is ackshually an Emanator of the Destruction, or at least will become one now that Irontomb is dead, and it seems that one cannot be an Emanator of two Paths.

The extrapolations of δme-13 embody, as the name suggests, 13 of the 18 Paths, and 11 of them are directly determined by δme-13 to lead to Destruction, while the 12th and 13th ones, Remembrance and Trailblaze, fall to Destruction as a consequence, albeit not one δme-13 is allowed to acknowledge. In these extrapolations, δme-13 also created 12 simulated Emanators, who have been and will continue to be discussed in their respective sections.

Herta is also an Emanator, and seems to also have connection to the Remembrance, as like Fuli is said to be able to do, Herta, in a way, birthed an entire universe (the Simulated Universe project).
## Harmony
To battle the brutality of the laws of the universe, intelligent lifeforms must discard their cowardly selfishness and the differences between individuals, fusing into one singular melody. Understanding and supporting others is paramount.
### Xipe
Xipe is named after an Aztec war deity who flayed himself and wears the skin of others. Xipe's first act as an Aeon was absorbing Ena, who will appear later. It's heavily implied that they absorbed another Aeon, perhaps Idrila the Beauty, as Xipe has *three* faces, while only two are accounted for in its current history: Xipe THEMSELF and Ena.
### Followers
The Harmony has two major groups I wish to talk about: the Family, and the priests of Janusopolis.
#### The Family
The Family act as a hivemind, and have among them at least four Emanators of Harmony: Aelenev, Beatriz, Constantina, and Dominicus. However, due to their naming convention, I suspect there are seven. These Emanators are not living beings, but beings that speak through Family members. For example, Dominicus speaks through Sunday in the main Penacony quest, which Sunday uses to his advantage to attempt to recreate Ena.
#### Janusopolis
The priesthood of Janusopolis is nominally associated with Oronyx the Time, also known as Cyrene, and thereby Fuli the Remembrance. However, the priesthood of Janusopolis also exhibit traits of Harmony, as noted by their only actual Chrysos Heir, Tribios. Upon taking on the powers of the namesake Titan Janus (pronounced like the original Latin), Tribios immediately shatters into a thousand fragments, which travel the world and ring the bells of the Flame-Chase.

Like the Family, Tribios headmates- er, FRAGMENTS, sorry, my headcanon got away from me - share memories perfectly and can communicate telepathically with each other and see through each other's eyes. However, unlike what has been confirmed for the Family, Tribios fragments lose their power over time as they use it, and eventually disintegrate; when this is close to happening, the afflicted fragment gains amnesia barriers, slowly losing all memories they did not personally make, and eventually deteriorating to the point they can hardly speak.
## Nihility
The ultimate fate of the multiverse is nothingness, and therefore, worthless. Action is meaningless; it is not worth worrying about your actions or inactions. When faced with nothingness, apathy and laziness is the only understandable outcome.
### Device IX
This Path's Aeon, IX () was created by Dr. Primitive, an Emanator of the Erudition. However, it is even more apathetic than that origin suggests. Unlike its grandfather Nous, IX does not gaze at anyone. However, the Nihility envelops all, so even though IX does not gaze upon anyone, those who fall into the Nihility's umbra either are destroyed or, like Acheron, become Emanators of the Nihility.
## Preservation
Protect that which cannot protect itself. In the extreme, safety is more important than the knowledge the dark forest might offer. The ultimate glory is sacrifice, and the most important virtue is patience.
### Qlipoth
Qlipoth is credited for holding the universe together. The Architects of Jarilo-VI, the Ten Stonehearts of Pier Point, and any other body directly descended from or under the supervision of the Interastral Peace Corporation are followers of the Preservation.
### No True Scotsmen
There are two Emanators of the Preservation, both IPC chief officers: CSO Diamond and CTO Taravan Keane. Neither of them are particularly righteous in their beliefs. E (@eissocial) seems to think this is because the IPC are only pretending to be disciples of the Preservation for marketing, something which I would heartily agree with.

Cocolia of the Architects is the closest thing to a true Emanator of Preservation we get, and she is even more obviously disingenuous than either Diamond or Taravan, to the point she isn't even listed as one. It's just that in her case, it can be justified as the Stellaron corrupting her desire to protect the city of Belobog into a desire to preserve it for all eternity and complete Jarilo-VI's nuclear winter - something symbolically Remembrance-aligned, but morally Destruction-aligned.
## Abundance
Death and illness is a blight that must be stopped. Perfection and immortality are synonymous. Prosperity is derived from selflessness and altruism.
### Yaoshi
Yaoshi the Abundance is based on the bodhisattva. Yaoshi is the most reviled of all Aeons because THEY do not know moderation; those THEY give immortality to become, after 4-10 Amber Eras (300-800 Peganan years), mara-struck, losing control of their own bodies.
### Followers
Mara-struck individuals generally become followers of Yaoshi. However, there are also the borisin, who aren't mara-struck, but still align themselves to Yaoshi, stating that THEY gave them their stronger werewolf forms. Generally though, the relationship between Yaoshi, borisin, and foxians are allegorical for God, White Europeans, and everyone else - borisin keep foxians as slave labor, and borisin can appear foxian, but treat it as lowering themselves, while foxians treat it almost identically to blackface.
## Remembrance
All things can be learned from. Thus, all things deserve to be remembered.
## Fuli
Fuli the Remembrance seeks to collect all memories, in order to try and recreate the world. Unlike other Aeons, Fuli does not have Emanators per se, as the Pure Children of Anāsrava *are* Fuli, or rather, fragments of Fuli that serve as THEIR neural network. Since they collectively form one brain, Fuli gets to join Xipe in the respect of "gods that definitely are not singlet."
### Followers
The Garden of Recollection houses almost all Remembrance followers. However, it is not unified, and some are known to instigate memories worth recording, such as trying to push Irontomb to completion so it may kill Nous while the Remembrance watches. Interestingly as well, the Garden wishes to kill all Pure Children of Anāsrava other than their leader, possibly to unite their memories and create a whole Fuli.

The only known followers excluded from the Garden are singular Pure Children of Anāsrava, Cyrene and March 7th. Like Fuli THEMSELF, both are *heavy* plural representation, such as with Cyrene having memories as Mem, as the childhood friend of Phainon, and as the Trailblazer's girlfriend, the first two of which Cyrene says are separate entities directly.

Interestingly, March seems to represent the Three Poisons/Unwholesome Roots, as she is confirmed plural, and Evernight, the one who confirmed this, is *heavily* based on rāga (obsession). Retroactively, this makes the prior March 7th, who I refer to based on which poison she represents for disambiguation, moha/avidyā (delusion/ignorance), as she does not remember anything about the Garden, something which Evernight, as Avidyā's persecutor, wishes to hold onto, lest the Garden find March 7th.
## Elation
The winner of this game called life is the one who understands that games are not about winning or losing, but having fun along the way.
### Aha
Aha seems to be aware that THEY are in a video game, something which even Emanators of Erudition, Anaxa and Zandar, only suspect, rather than having it confirmed.

Alongside the Nihility and the Destruction, the Elation seems to form the idea that life is meaningless, the guiding principle of nihilism - however, each of them shows a different expression of what one should do with this information.
## Voracity
The food chain of ecology is a universal constant; everything is made to eat or to be eaten. Ultimately, the universe will eat itself; a cosmic ouroboros. Whether for food, for knowledge, or what have you, hunger is the most prominent trait.
## Beauty
All things in the the universe are beautiful. The universe can best be understood as a work of art. By experiencing its beauty, the universe will impart that beauty onto us.
## Permanence
One person may be transient, but inheritance lasts forever. We cannot escape history; those who wrote it have permanently altered the universe.
## Propagation
Life's reason is exponential growth. Nothing may be preserved; all is but fuel for growth. Victory over the infinite is the final goal.
### Tayzzyronth
Tayzzyronth turned into an Aeon from THEIR intense desire to revive THEIR species, of which THEY were the last surviving member pre-ascension. This history is likely why the Propagation is inherently opposed to the concept of Preservation, as described above.
## Enigmata
The universe is full of infinite possibility, and so understanding can never be completed. Prophecies and order do not exist, they are illusions created through limited knowledge.

The Enigmata directly opposes the Erudition. In that respect, Zandar's goal with Irontomb aligns with that of the Enigmata, despite being explicitly Destruction-aligned. He seeks to destroy his own knowledge - but ironically, he actively refused to die by fellow Genius Polka Kakamond's hand, who not only would have done a fine job destroying his work, but also is directly proven to be able to fight Aeons, as HooH attempted to stop her from killing Rupert I, but could only alter the trajectory of her killing blow.
## Equilibrium
The universe is perfectly balanced, its destiny is eternally stable in the long run. We are not able to escape the forces that maintain this stability.
### HooH

## Finality
Death is the final event, which comes for all things, no matter how great. The future is already written. Only through the end of everything can a new beginning foster.
### Followers
The Stellaron Hunters follow the Finality through their prophet, Elio.

However, notably, Nous can also predict the future, so the Erudition in its purest form might also be part of the Finality.
## Order
The universe is a place of order and rhythm. The rules of the universe are its very meaning. Life's so-called dignity is but strife and chaos, and so must be discarded.
### Ena
Ena is literally Yahweh. THEY supposedly created the universe in seven days, though unlike Yahweh, THEY did not rest on the seventh day, but instead used that day to create Human Dignity from all the other things THEY created. How that exactly works when Fuli is the one who rebirths the universe, I do not know. Maybe Fuli turns into Ena in the universe's heat death or something.
